This repository provides all code and scripts needed to reproduce the finite element simulations presented in:

Xu Q; Hofmeyer H; Maljaars J; Van Herpen R.A.P.: Pyrolysis modelling of insulation material in coupled fire-structure simulations, Journal of Building Engineering, submitted.
Xu Q: Simulations of Sandwich Panel Systems under Fire: Two-Scale Methods for Connections, Pyrolysis for Insulation, Experimental Validations, Chapter 4, PhD-thesis, in preparation.

The code and scripts have been provided by Qingfeng Xu, fall under his responsibility, and have not been checked on the code level by coauthors and/or supervisors.

The first release of this repository is empty and is only meant for generating a DOI. After publication of either the journal paper or the thesis above, actual code and scripts will be added for an updated release.
